	•	Create postman script which will choose the environment then based on environment choose the application then based on application choose client id and secret
	•	ChatGPT said:
	•	ChatGPT
	•	To create a Postman script that automatically selects the environment, then chooses the application, and based on that application selects the client ID and secret, you can leverage Postman's pre-request scripts and environment variables.
	•	Here’s a step-by-step guide:
	•	1. Set Up Environments in Postman
	•	Define different environments for your various setups (e.g., Development, Staging, Production).
	•	For each environment, add variables for application, client_id, and client_secret.
	•	2. Define Environment Variables
	•	For each environment, define variables like this:
	•	Environment: Development
	◦	application : app1
	◦	client_id_app1 : your-dev-app1-client-id
	◦	client_secret_app1 : your-dev-app1-client-secret
	◦	client_id_app2 : your-dev-app2-client-id
	◦	client_secret_app2 : your-dev-app2-client-secret
	•	Environment: Production
	◦	application : app1
	◦	client_id_app1 : your-prod-app1-client-id
	◦	client_secret_app1 : your-prod-app1-client-secret
	◦	client_id_app2 : your-prod-app2-client-id
	◦	client_secret_app2 : your-prod-app2-client-secret
	•	3. Create a Pre-request Script
	•	Use this script in your Postman collection or individual request:
	•	javascript
	•	Copy code
	•	// Get the environment name and application name
	•	let environment = pm.environment.name;
	•	let application = pm.environment.get("application");
	•	
	•	// Construct the variable names for client ID and secret
	•	let client_id_key = `client_id_${application}`;
	•	let client_secret_key = `client_secret_${application}`;
	•	
	•	// Get the client ID and secret from the environment variables
	•	let client_id = pm.environment.get(client_id_key);
	•	let client_secret = pm.environment.get(client_secret_key);
	•	
	•	// Set the client ID and secret as variables for use in the request
	•	pm.variables.set("client_id", client_id);
	•	pm.variables.set("client_secret", client_secret);
	•	
	•	console.log(`Environment: ${environment}`);
	•	console.log(`Application: ${application}`);
	•	console.log(`Client ID: ${client_id}`);
	•	console.log(`Client Secret: ${client_secret}`);
	•	4. Use the Variables in Your Request
	•	In the headers, body, or authentication fields of your request, use {{client_id}} and {{client_secret}} as placeholders.
	•	Example in Authorization (if using OAuth2):
	•	Client ID: {{client_id}}
	•	Client Secret: {{client_secret}}
	•	5. Testing the Script
	•	Switch between different environments and execute the request.
	•	The pre-request script will automatically pick the correct client_id and client_secret based on the selected environment and application.
	•	This approach allows for a flexible setup where you can easily switch between environments and applications, and the correct credentials will be automatically selected.
	•	You said:
	•	Use hashmap way of storing value in postman environment and then fetching details out of it to satisfy previous query
	•	ChatGPT said:
	•	ChatGPT
	•	Using a hashmap-like structure in Postman to store and retrieve values involves a bit of JSON manipulation within environment variables. Here's how you can achieve this:
	•	1. Set Up the Environment Variables
	•	In each environment, you’ll define a single environment variable (e.g., app_credentials) that holds a JSON object with the client IDs and secrets for each application.
	•	Example Environment Setup:
	•	Environment: Development
	◦	app_credentials:jsonCopy code  {
	◦	  "app1": {
	◦	    "client_id": "your-dev-app1-client-id",
	◦	    "client_secret": "your-dev-app1-client-secret"
	◦	  },
	◦	  "app2": {
	◦	    "client_id": "your-dev-app2-client-id",
	◦	    "client_secret": "your-dev-app2-client-secret"
	◦	  }
	◦	}
	◦	  
	•	Environment: Production
	◦	app_credentials:jsonCopy code  {
	◦	  "app1": {
	◦	    "client_id": "your-prod-app1-client-id",
	◦	    "client_secret": "your-prod-app1-client-secret"
	◦	  },
	◦	  "app2": {
	◦	    "client_id": "your-prod-app2-client-id",
	◦	    "client_secret": "your-prod-app2-client-secret"
	◦	  }
	◦	}
	◦	  
	•	2. Create a Pre-request Script
	•	In your Postman collection or individual request, add the following pre-request script to fetch the client_id and client_secret for the chosen application:
	•	javascript
	•	Copy code
	•	// Retrieve the application name from the environment variable
	•	let application = pm.environment.get("application");
	•	
	•	// Retrieve the credentials object from the environment
	•	let appCredentials = pm.environment.get("app_credentials");
	•	appCredentials = JSON.parse(appCredentials); // Parse the JSON string into an object
	•	
	•	// Fetch the client_id and client_secret for the given application
	•	let client_id = appCredentials[application]?.client_id;
	•	let client_secret = appCredentials[application]?.client_secret;
	•	
	•	// Set these values as variables for use in the request
	•	if (client_id && client_secret) {
	•	    pm.variables.set("client_id", client_id);
	•	    pm.variables.set("client_secret", client_secret);
	•	    console.log(`Application: ${application}`);
	•	    console.log(`Client ID: ${client_id}`);
	•	    console.log(`Client Secret: ${client_secret}`);
	•	} else {
	•	    console.error(`No credentials found for application: ${application}`);
	•	}
	•	3. Use the Variables in Your Request
	•	In your requests, use {{client_id}} and {{client_secret}} wherever you need the client ID and secret.
	•	4. Testing the Setup
	•	Switch Environments: Change the environment between Development and Production.
	•	Set Application: Before running the request, ensure that the application variable is set to the correct app (e.g., app1 or app2).
	•	Execute the Request: Run the request and observe the console logs to verify that the correct client_id and client_secret are being fetched and used.
	•	This method is highly scalable and allows for easy management of credentials across multiple applications and environments.
	•	You said:
	•	Make one json entry which will have all the v5 as old version v10 as new version then it will hold dev, pre, prod as three environment then inside that all the apps and then for each app different client and secret. And way to retrieve them
	•	ChatGPT said:
	•	ChatGPT
	•	To set up a JSON structure that holds all the credentials for different versions, environments, and applications, you can structure your JSON object like this:
	•	1. JSON Structure
	•	Here’s how you can structure the app_credentials variable:
	•	json
	•	Copy code
	•	{
	•	  "v5": {
	•	    "dev": {
	•	      "app1": {
	•	        "client_id": "v5-dev-app1-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v5-dev-app1-client-secret"
	•	      },
	•	      "app2": {
	•	        "client_id": "v5-dev-app2-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v5-dev-app2-client-secret"
	•	      }
	•	    },
	•	    "pre": {
	•	      "app1": {
	•	        "client_id": "v5-pre-app1-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v5-pre-app1-client-secret"
	•	      },
	•	      "app2": {
	•	        "client_id": "v5-pre-app2-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v5-pre-app2-client-secret"
	•	      }
	•	    },
	•	    "prod": {
	•	      "app1": {
	•	        "client_id": "v5-prod-app1-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v5-prod-app1-client-secret"
	•	      },
	•	      "app2": {
	•	        "client_id": "v5-prod-app2-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v5-prod-app2-client-secret"
	•	      }
	•	    }
	•	  },
	•	  "v10": {
	•	    "dev": {
	•	      "app1": {
	•	        "client_id": "v10-dev-app1-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v10-dev-app1-client-secret"
	•	      },
	•	      "app2": {
	•	        "client_id": "v10-dev-app2-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v10-dev-app2-client-secret"
	•	      }
	•	    },
	•	    "pre": {
	•	      "app1": {
	•	        "client_id": "v10-pre-app1-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v10-pre-app1-client-secret"
	•	      },
	•	      "app2": {
	•	        "client_id": "v10-pre-app2-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v10-pre-app2-client-secret"
	•	      }
	•	    },
	•	    "prod": {
	•	      "app1": {
	•	        "client_id": "v10-prod-app1-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v10-prod-app1-client-secret"
	•	      },
	•	      "app2": {
	•	        "client_id": "v10-prod-app2-client-id",
	•	        "client_secret": "v10-prod-app2-client-secret"
	•	      }
	•	    }
	•	  }
	•	}
	•	2. Storing the JSON in an Environment Variable
	•	In your Postman environment (for example, Development), create an environment variable called app_credentials and paste the above JSON structure into it.
	•	3. Pre-request Script to Retrieve the Client ID and Secret
	•	Use the following script to dynamically retrieve the credentials based on the version, environment, and application:
	•	javascript
	•	Copy code
	•	// Retrieve version, environment, and application from environment variables
	•	let version = pm.environment.get("version");      // e.g., 'v5' or 'v10'
	•	let environment = pm.environment.get("env");     // e.g., 'dev', 'pre', 'prod'
	•	let application = pm.environment.get("application");  // e.g., 'app1', 'app2'
	•	
	•	// Retrieve the credentials JSON object from the environment variable
	•	let appCredentials = pm.environment.get("app_credentials");
	•	appCredentials = JSON.parse(appCredentials);  // Parse JSON string into object
	•	
	•	// Fetch the client_id and client_secret for the given version, environment, and application
	•	let client_id = appCredentials[version]?.[environment]?.[application]?.client_id;
	•	let client_secret = appCredentials[version]?.[environment]?.[application]?.client_secret;
	•	
	•	// Set these values as variables for use in the request
	•	if (client_id && client_secret) {
	•	    pm.variables.set("client_id", client_id);
	•	    pm.variables.set("client_secret", client_secret);
	•	    console.log(`Version: ${version}`);
	•	    console.log(`Environment: ${environment}`);
	•	    console.log(`Application: ${application}`);
	•	    console.log(`Client ID: ${client_id}`);
	•	    console.log(`Client Secret: ${client_secret}`);
	•	} else {
	•	    console.error(`No credentials found for version: ${version}, environment: ${environment}, application: ${application}`);
	•	}
	•	4. Setting Variables
	•	Before running the request, set the following environment variables:
	•	version: Set this to v5 or v10.
	•	env: Set this to dev, pre, or prod.
	•	application: Set this to app1, app2, etc.
	•	5. Using the Variables in Your Request
	•	In your requests, use {{client_id}} and {{client_secret}} wherever you need the client ID and secret.
	•	6. Testing the Setup
	•	Switch between versions and environments by updating the version, env, and application variables.
	•	Run the request and verify that the correct client_id and client_secret are being used as per the selected version, environment, and application.
	•	This setup allows you to manage multiple versions, environments, and applications efficiently within a single JSON object, making it easier to scale and maintain.
